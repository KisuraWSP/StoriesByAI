        The sun over Jaffna does not caress; it interrogates. It bleaches the color from the colonial Dutch walls and turns the red earth into a fine, choking powder that settles in the lungs.
        Dr. Silas Thiruchelvam did not mind the heat. He did not mind the dust. Standing on the veranda of his renovated ancestral home near the Nallur Kandaswamy Temple, he watched a crow pick at the carcass of a gecko. Silas was perfectly still. He was wearing a white linen suit, uncreased, impervious to the humidity that made other men weep sweat.
        Silas was a creature of absence. He possessed a void where his conscience should be. He was the architect of his own reality, a charming, high-functioning psychopath who viewed the world as a complex spreadsheet of assets and liabilities.
        The gate creaked. A rusting, violent sound.
        Enter liability number one: Ravi.
        Ravi was the antithesis of Silas. If Silas was ice, Ravi was fire—uncontrolled, smoky, and prone to burning down his own house to kill a spider. Ravi was a sociopath, forged in the chaotic fires of the past decades, a man whose morality had been shattered by trauma and poorly glued back together with rage and impulse.
        Ravi stormed up the driveway, kicking a stone into the carefully manicured bed of jasmine. He was sweating profusely, his shirt dark at the armpits, his eyes darting like a trapped animal's.
        "You’re not answering your phone, Silas," Ravi spat, mounting the steps. He smelled of cheap arrack and old panic.
        "I was observing nature," Silas said, his voice a smooth baritone, devoid of alarm. "It is feeding time."
        "They found the ledger," Ravi hissed, getting too close. "The excavation near the fort. The foreman called me. He said they found the box."
        Silas took a sip of his tea. It was perfectly lukewarm. "Sit down, Ravi. You look like you’re about to have a stroke."
        "Don't tell me to sit! If they open that box, they find the deeds. They find the transfers. They trace it back to the erratic land seizures in '09. They trace it to us."
        Ravi began to pace, vibrating with kinetic energy. This was the difference between them, Silas noted with clinical detachment. Ravi felt fear. He felt it viscerally. He had no empathy for the people they had displaced, true, but he had a terrifying abundance of self-preservation instinct that manifested as aggression. He was a jagged, rusty knife. Silas, conversely, was a scalpel.
        "It is a box in the ground, Ravi. It is inert. You, however, are active. You are making noise."
        "I’m going to go there tonight," Ravi said, his eyes widening with a manic idea. "I’ll burn the foreman’s office. I’ll torch the whole site. Make it look like an accident."
        Silas sighed. This was the problem with sociopaths. They lacked vision. They were reactive, slaves to their adrenaline. "Arson at a protected archaeological site near the Jaffna Fort? Subtle. Why not just sign a confession and staple it to the Police Station door?"
        "Then what?" Ravi screamed, grabbing the edge of the cane table. The china rattled. "You sit here in your ivory tower, listening to temple bells, while the noose tightens!"
        "The noose is a rope, Ravi. It only tightens if you thrash." Silas set his cup down. "I have already spoken to the foreman. His daughter has been accepted into a very prestigious university in Colombo, on a full scholarship provided by my foundation. The box will be lost. Misplaced in the inventory. It will cease to exist."
        Ravi stopped pacing. He blinked, the rage stalling in his chest. "You... you paid him off?"
        "I leveraged him. People are simple mechanisms. Gears and levers. You just have to find the pressure point."
        Ravi slumped into a chair, the adrenaline crash leaving him trembling. He looked at Silas with a mixture of awe and revulsion. Ravi knew he was a monster; he felt the jagged edges of his own broken soul every day. But looking at Silas was like looking into a black hole. There was no turbulence, no conflict. Just a smooth, devouring gravity.
        "You're cold, machan," Ravi whispered. "Even the devil sweats in Jaffna. But not you."
        "Emotion is inefficiency," Silas said, standing up. "Now, I have a problem, Ravi. A loose end."
        "The foreman?" Ravi asked, his eyes lighting up, the violence returning. "I can handle him. Quietly."
        Silas smiled. It was a practiced expression, involving only the zygomatic major muscles, leaving the eyes dead. "No, Ravi. The foreman is an asset. The loose end is the man who panicked. The man who wanted to commit arson in broad daylight. The man whose impulsive nature is a statistical probability for future failure."
        Ravi froze. The sound of the temple puja drums began to beat in the distance, a rhythmic thudding that matched the heart rate of a terrified man.
        "Silas," Ravi said, his voice trembling. "We go back twenty years."
        "Sunk cost fallacy," Silas replied.
        Silas didn't reach for a weapon. He didn't need to. He simply nodded toward the gate where two uniformed men—private security, paid double the market rate—were walking up the driveway.
        Ravi stood up, his chaotic energy spiking. He reached for the knife he kept in his belt, the reflex of a man who had lived his whole life fighting.
        "Don't," Silas advised gently. "It’s too hot for a struggle. And besides, the tea is excellent today."
        As the men took Ravi—kicking, screaming, spitting curses that hung heavy in the humid air—Silas turned back to the garden. The crow had finished the gecko and was now wiping its beak on the palmyrah fence.
        Silas checked his watch. The sun was beginning to dip, casting long, sharp shadows across the veranda. The geometry of the afternoon was restored. The variable had been removed. The equation was balanced once more.
