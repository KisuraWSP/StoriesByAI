        The fog at Idalgashinna is not like the fog in Colombo. In the city, the mist is just heat and dust. Here, on the ridge of the mountains, the mist is a living thing. It is cold, white, and swallows the world whole.
        Nethra sat on the edge of the railway platform, her legs dangling over the tracks. It was 5:00 PM, but it looked like midnight. The station, usually bustling with hikers, was deserted. The last train to Badulla had left an hour ago.
        Nethra was twenty-three, but she felt ancient.
        She wasn't crying. That was the misconception people had about this kind of darkness—they thought it was a thunderstorm. It wasn't. It was a drought. It was a drying up of every drop of color, every drop of hope, until all that was left was a grey, dusty silence.
        I am just so tired, she thought.
        It wasn't the kind of tired that sleep could fix. It was a heaviness in her bones. The effort it took to brush her teeth, to answer a text, to smile at her mother—it felt like carrying a bag of wet cement up a mountain. She had been carrying it for years. And today, looking at the white void where the tea plantations should be, she thought about putting the bag down.
        She looked at the tracks. Iron and wood. Cold and hard.
        If I just walked into the mist, she told herself, I would just disappear. No more noise. No more trying.
        The thought was seductive. It wasn't scary; it felt like a warm blanket. The pain in her chest—the constant, squeezing anxiety that she wasn't good enough, that she was a burden, that she was broken—would finally stop.
        She stood up. The wind whipped her hair across her face. She stepped off the platform onto the gravel ballast.
        Crunch. Crunch.
        She walked toward the end of the station, where the ridge narrowed and the drop was steep. The mist wrapped around her, dampening her clothes, chilling her skin. She felt like she was already a ghost.
        One more step, the darkness whispered. Just let go.
        Then, she heard a sound.
        It was a small, pathetic sound. A whimper.
        Nethra stopped. The silence of the mountain was usually absolute. She looked down.
        Curled up against the rusty lever of the track switch, half-buried in the wet grass, was a puppy. It couldn't have been more than four weeks old. It was soaking wet, shivering so violently that its whole body shook. It was alone.
        Nethra stared at it. "You're cold," she whispered, her voice cracking. She hadn't spoken in days.
        The puppy lifted its head. Its eyes were milky and terrified. It let out another cry, a high-pitched plea for help.
        Nethra looked at the edge of the ridge. It was five feet away. The void was waiting.
        She looked back at the puppy. The tiny creature was freezing. If she left, it would die in the night. The mist would take it, just like it wanted to take her.
        I can't save myself, Nethra thought. But...
        She knelt down. The gravel dug into her knees. She reached out a trembling hand. The puppy flinched, then sniffed her fingers. It licked her thumb. The tongue was rough and warm.
        That tiny point of warmth shot through Nethra’s frozen arm like a lightning bolt.
        She scooped the puppy up. It was light, nothing more than fur and bones. She unzipped her jacket and tucked the shivering animal inside, against her chest.
        "It's okay," she murmured, tears finally spilling over, hot and fast. "I've got you."
        The weight of the puppy against her heart felt heavy, but it was a different kind of weight. It wasn't the dead weight of cement. It was the weight of life. It was a heartbeat that wasn't her own, demanding to be protected.
        Nethra stood there for a long time, the mist swirling around her. She was still in pain. She was still tired. The darkness was still there.
        But she couldn't leave. Not yet. She had to get the puppy some milk. She had to dry it off. She had to see if it would survive the night.
        And if she had to stay for the puppy, she had to stay for herself, too. Just for tonight. Maybe just for the next hour
        Nethra turned her back on the edge of the ridge. She stepped up onto the platform, clutching the jacket tight around the small life inside.
        She walked toward the Station Master's office, where a warm yellow light was glowing through the window.
        I am still here, she thought, the words fragile but true. I am still here.
