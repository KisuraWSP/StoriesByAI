        The BMW 5-Series was a machine designed for German autobahns, not for the potholed, sun-blasted tarmac of the Habarana–Polonnaruwa road.
        Mr. Wickramasinghe checked his watch. 1:00 PM. The temperature dashboard read 36°C outside. He was late for a resort inspection in Pasikudah. He pressed the accelerator, ignoring the rattling sound coming from the engine.
        Hiss.
        A cloud of white steam erupted from the hood, blinding him. The car shuddered and died.
        Wickramasinghe wrestled the steering wheel, guiding the heavy vehicle onto the gravel shoulder. Silence descended, broken only by the aggressive chirping of cicadas and the ticking of the cooling metal.
        He stepped out. The heat hit him like a physical blow. The air shimmered above the asphalt. He checked his phone. No Service.
        "Wonderful," he muttered, wiping sweat from his forehead with a silk handkerchief. He was miles from the nearest town. On one side was dense, dry scrub jungle—elephant territory. On the other, endless paddy fields burned brown by the drought.
        He heard a bicycle squeaking.
        Wickramasinghe tensed. He was a wealthy man alone on a deserted road. He watched as an old man on a bicycle loaded with King Coconuts (Thambili) slowly approached. The man wore a faded sarong and a shirt that had been mended so many times it was more thread than fabric.
        The cyclist stopped. He looked at the steaming car, then at the sweating man in the suit.
        "Trouble, Sir?" the old man asked. His face was a map of wrinkles, carved by seventy years of sun.
        "Radiator," Wickramasinghe said shortly. He didn't want to engage. He just wanted a tow truck.
        The old man kicked the stand of his bicycle. He pulled a machete from his belt.
        Wickramasinghe stepped back, his heart hammering. "Look, I don't have much cash—"
        The old man ignored him. He walked to the front of his bike, selected the largest, golden-orange Thambili, and sliced the top off with three precise strokes. Thwack. Thwack. Slice.
        He held it out.
        "Drink, Sir. The heat is bad for the blood."
        Wickramasinghe hesitated, then took it. He drank greedily. The sweet, cool water washed away the dust and the panic.
        "Thank you," Wickramasinghe said, reaching for his wallet. "How much?"
        The old man waved his hand dismissively. He walked over to the car and popped the hood. He used a rag from his pocket to open the radiator cap. Steam hissed out.
        "Bone dry," the old man said. "You have water?"
        "No," Wickramasinghe admitted. "I... I forgot to restock."
        The old man walked back to his bicycle. Tied to the frame was a 5-liter plastic bottle of water. It was clearly his personal supply for the day. The water level was half full.
        Without a word, the old man walked to the engine and began pouring his drinking water into the radiator.
        "Wait!" Wickramasinghe said. "That's your water. You need that."
        "The machine needs it more right now," the old man said, emptying the bottle until the last drop vanished into the thirsty engine. "This will get you to the garage in Habarana. Five kilometers."
        He closed the hood. "Try it now."
        Wickramasinghe got in. He pushed the button. The engine purred to life. The temperature gauge began to drop.
        He got out, feeling a sudden, overwhelming sense of shame. He had judged this man. He had feared him. And this man had just given him his inventory and his water.
        Wickramasinghe opened his wallet. He pulled out a five-thousand rupee note. It was enough to buy the man's entire bicycle.
        "Here," Wickramasinghe said. "Please. Take it."
        The old man looked at the money, then up at Wickramasinghe’s eyes. He smiled, revealing betel-stained teeth.
        "Keep it, Sir."
        "But you gave me a Thambili. You gave me your water. You saved me."
        "Sir," the old man said, climbing back onto his bicycle. "If I sell you the Thambili, I am a merchant. If I sell you the water, I am a businessman. But if I help a stranger on a hot road, I am a human being."
        He adjusted his hat. "Today, I just wanted to be a human being. That is payment enough."
        The old man pushed off, the bicycle squeaking rhythmically as he pedaled away into the shimmering heat haze.
        Wickramasinghe stood there for a long time, holding the crisp banknote in his hand. It fluttered in the dry wind, useless. He got back into his luxury car, but as he drove away, he felt poorer than he had ever felt in his life.
