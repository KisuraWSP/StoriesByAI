    <p class="note">
        In the criminal archives of Colombo, there was a file on a man named Somsiri. They called him Mitiya—The Sledgehammer. Legend said he could knock a man unconscious with a single slap, that his heart was made of the same cold iron as the tools he was named after.
        But that was ten years ago.
        Now, Somsiri lived in Ahangama, down a narrow, sandy lane where the sound of the Matara-bound train rattled the windows every hour.
        He did not look like a monster anymore. He looked like a mountain that had decided to become a hill. His massive shoulders were stooped, not from carrying the guilt of his past, but from carrying bags of compost. Somsiri grew orchids.
        It was a ridiculous profession for a man with hands the size of coconuts. His fingers, once used to break debts out of stubborn shopkeepers, now possessed a surgeon’s delicacy. He spent his days coaxing purple dendrobiums and delicate vanilla vines to life in the humid salt air.
        The sun was setting over the Indian Ocean, painting the sky in bruises of purple and orange, when the gate rattled.
        Three young men entered. They wore tight denim jeans, mirrored sunglasses, and the swagger of boys who had watched too many action movies but had never actually been punched in the face. They were local muscle, hired by a hotel developer who wanted Somsiri’s plot of land for a new yoga retreat.
        The leader, a wiry boy named Kasun, kicked a pot of ferns over. The ceramic shattered.
        Somsiri was kneeling by a bed of Jasmine. He didn't flinch. He carefully finished tying a stalk to a bamboo support before standing up. He towered over them, a scarred, silent giant.
        "Get out, old man," Kasun spat, pulling a rusted butterfly knife from his pocket. He twirled it clumsily. "The boss says the offer is expired. Now you leave, or we make you leave."
        Ten years ago, Somsiri would have dismantled these three in less than six seconds. He knew the anatomy of violence; he knew exactly where to press to make a lung collapse or a knee give way. The old rage, the Mitiya, roared in the basement of his gut. It demanded blood.
        But Somsiri looked at the shattered fern. He looked at Kasun’s shaking hand. He saw the fear behind the boy's sunglasses.
        "It is hot today," Somsiri said. His voice was deep, like stones grinding together.
        The boys blinked. They stepped back, confused.
        "I made belimal tea," Somsiri continued, wiping his dirty hands on a rag. "With jaggery. You boys look thirsty."
        "We didn't come for tea!" Kasun shouted, though his voice cracked. "We came to break your legs!"
        "Legs can wait," Somsiri said, turning his back on the knife—the ultimate disrespect, or the ultimate trust. "Come. Sit."
        He walked onto his small veranda and began pouring steaming liquid into three clean porcelain cups.
        The boys exchanged glances. This wasn't in the script. The old man was supposed to beg, or fight. He wasn't supposed to offer hospitality. The confusion neutralized their aggression. Hesitantly, drawn by the smell of the herbal tea and the sheer gravitational pull of Somsiri’s calmness, they walked to the veranda.
        Kasun didn't sit, but he lowered the knife.
        Somsiri held out a cup. "You are holding that knife wrong, son."
        Kasun stiffened. "What?"
        "Your thumb. It’s too high. If you strike bone, your hand will slide and you will cut your own tendons." Somsiri took a sip of his tea. "I made that mistake once. In 1998. Took three months to heal."
        He held up his right hand. A jagged, white scar ran across the palm.
        The boys stared at the hand. They knew the stories. They suddenly realized who they were standing in front of. The air in the garden grew heavy.
        "You... you are him," Kasun whispered. The color drained from his face. "The Sledgehammer."
        "I was," Somsiri corrected. "Now I am just the man who grows orchids."
        He pointed to the shattered pot on the grass. "That fern was a Nephrolepis. It is very resilient. It will grow back if you replant it. But it takes time. Violence is fast, boys. Growing things... fixing things... that is slow. That is hard."
        Somsiri reached into his pocket. The boys flinched, expecting a weapon.
        He pulled out a small piece of dark, crystallized jaggery and placed it on the table next to the tea.
        "I could break you," Somsiri said softly, looking Kasun in the eye. There was no malice in his gaze, only a terrible, weary sadness. "I could bury you under the hibiscus before the train passes. But then who would water my flowers tomorrow? And who would worry your mothers?"
        He pushed the tea forward. "Drink. Then, please, replant my fern before you leave."
        Kasun looked at the knife in his hand. It looked silly now. A toy. He looked at the giant man who had chosen to be a gardener.
        Slowly, Kasun folded the knife and put it away. He picked up the tea. His hands were shaking, not with adrenaline, but with a sudden, overwhelming shame.
        "It's good tea, Uncle," one of the other boys mumbled, sipping quickly.
        They spent the next twenty minutes in silence. Under the supervision of the former enforcer, the three thugs knelt in the dirt, carefully scooping the soil back into a spare pot, burying the roots of the fern they had kicked over.
        When they were done, Somsiri gave them each a cutting of a purple orchid wrapped in damp newspaper.
        "Take this," he told them. "If you can keep it alive for a month, come back. I will teach you how to graft."
        "Why?" Kasun asked, wiping dirt from his expensive jeans. "Why didn't you hit us?"
        Somsiri watched the fireflies beginning to dance above the railway tracks.
        "Because," he said, "it is easy to be a storm. It is much harder to be the shelter."
        The three young men walked out of the gate, carrying the flowers like they were made of glass. Somsiri watched them go, then picked up his broom to sweep away the dust they had brought in.
