        The road to Panama does not end; it simply gives up. The asphalt crumbles into red gravel, the gravel fades into sand, and the sand eventually surrenders to the Indian Ocean.
        Kavi gripped the steering wheel of the battered jeep until his knuckles turned the color of old bone. Beside him, Amara was twisting the hem of her skirt, her eyes fixed on the side mirror.
        " Is it still there?" Kavi asked. His voice sounded thin, stretched tight over his panic.
        Amara didn't look at him. She stared into the reflection of the road behind them. "It’s faster now. It ate the lagoon."
        Kavi slammed his foot down. The jeep roared, kicking up a cloud of dust that instantly vanished. Not because it settled, but because It caught up to it.
        They were running from the Blur.
        It wasn't a monster. It wasn't an army. It was simply an absence. It had started in Monaragala two hours ago—a patch of sky that went grey, like a television losing signal. Then the trees vanished. Then the road signs. It was a wave of nothingness, erasing the world from west to east, turning high-definition reality into a flat, featureless void.
        Kavi was terrified, but beneath the fear was a crushing, cold uncertainty. He couldn't remember if he had paid the rent. He couldn't remember if he had locked the front door. He couldn't remember if he loved Amara, or if he was just afraid of dying alone. The Blur seemed to be feeding on this—on the gaps in his confidence, the cracks in his life.
        "Turn left!" Amara screamed.
        Kavi swerved. The jeep skidded past a herd of buffalo that stood like statues in the tall, dry grass. The Panama lagoon flashed by on their right—a mirror of dark water hiding crocodiles.
        "Where are we going, Kavi?" Amara cried, grabbing his arm. "There’s nothing out here! Just the dunes and the jungle!"
        "The ocean," Kavi gasped. "It can't erase the ocean. It’s too big. It’s too real."
        It was a desperate logic, born of a fever dream.
        They hit the sand dunes. The jeep bogged down, the engine whining in protest. Kavi killed the ignition. "Run."
        They scrambled out. The heat was physical, a heavy blanket of salt and dry earth. They climbed the golden ridge of the dune, their feet sinking into the burning sand.
        At the top, they stopped.
        Before them lay the ocean—violent, blue, and eternal. But behind them...
        Kavi looked back. The village of Panama was gone. The jungle was gone. The buffalo were gone. There was only a wall of static, a towering grey fog that made no sound. It was smooth and terrifyingly calm. It was the physical manifestation of "I don't know."
        It was the uncertainty of the future, finally arriving to consume the present.
        "It’s not stopping," Amara whispered. She backed away until her heels touched the wet sand of the shoreline.
        Kavi looked at the wall. It was fifty feet away. Then forty.
        "I don't know what to do," Kavi admitted, the confession tearing out of him. "Amara, I don't have a plan. I never had a plan. I’m just driving. I’m just guessing."
        The wall slowed. Just a fraction.
        Amara grabbed his hand. Her grip was painful. "Kavi, look at me."
        He turned away from the void. He looked at her—her windblown hair, the sweat on her forehead, the terror and the fierce life in her eyes.
        "You don't need to know," she said, her voice cutting through the roar of the surf. "You just need to be here. With me. Right now."
        The uncertainty in Kavi’s chest tightened. The Blur was fed by his doubt, his constant looking back, his fear that the path he was on was the wrong one.
        The wall was ten feet away. The heat coming off it was cold—the chill of an unlived life.
        Kavi squeezed Amara's hand. He stopped trying to figure out the escape route. He stopped trying to calculate the odds. He grounded himself in the sensation of the sand under his boots and the pulse in Amara’s wrist.
        "I am here," Kavi said. He turned his back on the grey wall and faced the ocean. "I am right here."
        He waited for the erasure. He waited to be deleted.
        But the silence didn't take him.
        Kavi opened his eyes. The roar of the ocean was still there. He looked over his shoulder.
        The Blur had stopped. It hung frozen, inches from the back of his shirt. It rippled, like a curtain caught in a breeze, unable to advance further.
        It could erase the past. It could swallow the road they came from. But it could not consume the place where they were standing, because for the first time in his life, Kavi wasn't unsure of where he was.
        He was standing on the edge of Panama, holding the hand of the woman he loved, facing the open sea.
        "Is it gone?" Amara whispered.
        "No," Kavi said, watching the wall of nothingness hover, waiting for him to doubt again. "It's waiting. But we’re still here."
        He stepped forward, pulling her toward the water, walking into the only thing he knew for sure.
