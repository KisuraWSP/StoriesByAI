    <p class="note">
        The sun was no longer a god to be worshipped; it was a hammer that struck the earth twelve hours a day.
        Kalana adjusted his goggles, wiping the red grit from the lenses. He stood on the edge of what used to be the Parakrama Samudra—the Sea of King Parakrama. Once, it had been a shimmering expanse of water, feeding thousands of acres of rice. Now, it was a vast, cracked bowl of clay, stretching out into the heat haze like a dried wound.
        "Baba," a small voice croaked. "Water?"
        Kalana looked down at Chimmi. She was eight years old. She was small for her age, her skin the color of burnt teak. She had never seen rain. She had never seen a coconut tree with leaves. To her, Sri Lanka had always been a desert.
        "Soon, podi duwa," Kalana lied. He offered her his canteen. It had two mouthfuls left.
        They were walking West, toward the jagged silhouette that rose out of the dunes like a rotting tooth. Sigiriya.
        Decades ago, the Fever had swept through the island, emptying the cities of Colombo and Kandy in weeks. Those who survived the sickness watched helplessly as the climate turned. The monsoons stopped coming. The Indian Ocean warmed, killing the currents that brought the rain. The lush "Pearl of the Indian Ocean" dried up and shriveled into a hard, brown pebble.
        "Tell me about the Green," Chimmi whispered as they trudged across the baked lake bed.
        "I have told you a thousand times," Kalana rasped, his throat feeling like it was full of sand.
        "Tell me again. To make the walking easy."
        Kalana sighed, closing his eyes against the glare.
        "Long ago, the ground was covered in a carpet that felt soft and cool, like velvet. We called it 'grass'. And there were trees—so many trees that you couldn't see the sky. They were full of water. If you cut a King Coconut, sweet water would pour out, more than you could drink."
        Chimmi laughed, a dry, cracking sound. "You're funny, Baba. Trees can't hold water. They are wood."
        "They were alive," Kalana insisted, memories stinging him. "And the rain... it would fall from the sky for days. The Kelani River would overflow. We complained about the mud. Can you imagine? We complained that there was too much water."
        They reached the base of the rock fortress by noon. The famous Lion Paws were gone, eroded by fifty years of relentless sandstorms. The rock itself was bleached white by the sun.
        "Why are we here?" Chimmi asked, collapsing into the sliver of shade offered by a fallen boulder.
        "Because the Old Kings knew," Kalana said. He began to dig at the base of the rock with a rusty trowel. "King Kashyapa didn't just build a palace. He built a machine."
        Kalana wasn't looking for gold. He was looking for the ancient hydraulics. The cisterns. The systems that collected rainwater and stored it deep within the cool heart of the granite.
        He dug for an hour. His hands bled. The heat was nearing 45°C.
        Clink.
        Metal on stone.
        Kalana brushed away the sand. It wasn't an ancient stone slab. It was a rusted hatch, stamped with the emblem of the Sri Lankan Army, dated 2035—just before the Collapse.
        "The Retrofit," Kalana breathed. "The rumors were true."
        He pried the wheel. It groaned, the seal cracking. A puff of stale, cool air hissed out.
        "Chimmi, come."
        They slid into the darkness.
        Inside, it wasn't a palace. It was a bunker, retrofitted into the ancient cisterns. It was dark, illuminated only by the dying beam of Kalana’s flashlight.
        And there, in the center of the damp stone room, was a sound.
        Drip. Drip. Drip.
        Chimmi froze. "What is that noise?"
        "That," Kalana said, tears cutting tracks through the dust on his face, "is the sound of the past."
        In the center of the room was a condensation trap—a simple device harvesting the moisture from the deep earth. A slow, steady drop of water fell into a stone basin.
        It wasn't a river. It wasn't a lake. It was maybe three liters of water.
        But next to the basin, under a dusty UV light that had long since burned out, was a glass box. Inside the box, preserved in nutrient gel, was a single, green sprout.
        A Bo sapling.
        Chimmi walked up to it. She reached out and touched the glass. Her eyes went wide.
        "It's... it's the color of your stories," she whispered.
        "It's Green," Kalana choked out.
        He scooped a cup of water from the basin and handed it to her. She drank, her eyes closing in ecstasy as the cool liquid hit her parched throat.
        "We stay here," Kalana said, sliding to the floor, his journey done. "We guard the drop. And we guard the Green."
        Outside, the wind howled across the barren, scorched plains of the dry zone, burying the history of the island under another layer of sand. But inside the rock, deep in the dark, the heart of Sri Lanka was still beating. Faintly.
