    <h1 class="title">Part I: The Dry Sea</h1>
    <p class="note">
        The sun was no longer a god to be worshipped; it was a hammer that struck the earth twelve hours a day.
        Kalana adjusted his goggles, wiping the red grit from the lenses. He stood on the edge of what used to be the Parakrama Samudra—the Sea of King Parakrama. Once, it had been a shimmering expanse of water, feeding thousands of acres of rice. Now, it was a vast, cracked bowl of clay, stretching out into the heat haze like a dried wound.
        "Baba," a small voice croaked. "Water?"
        Kalana looked down at Chimmi. She was eight years old. She was small for her age, her skin the color of burnt teak. She had never seen rain. She had never seen a coconut tree with leaves. To her, Sri Lanka had always been a desert.
        "Soon, podi duwa," Kalana lied. He offered her his canteen. It had two mouthfuls left.
        They were walking West, toward the jagged silhouette that rose out of the dunes like a rotting tooth. Sigiriya.
        Decades ago, the Fever had swept through the island, emptying the cities of Colombo and Kandy in weeks. Those who survived the sickness watched helplessly as the climate turned. The monsoons stopped coming. The Indian Ocean warmed, killing the currents that brought the rain. The lush "Pearl of the Indian Ocean" dried up and shriveled into a hard, brown pebble.
        "Tell me about the Green," Chimmi whispered as they trudged across the baked lake bed.
        "I have told you a thousand times," Kalana rasped, his throat feeling like it was full of sand.
        "Tell me again. To make the walking easy."
        Kalana sighed, closing his eyes against the glare.
        "Long ago, the ground was covered in a carpet that felt soft and cool, like velvet. We called it 'grass'. And there were trees—so many trees that you couldn't see the sky. They were full of water. If you cut a King Coconut, sweet water would pour out, more than you could drink."
        Chimmi laughed, a dry, cracking sound. "You're funny, Baba. Trees can't hold water. They are wood."
        "They were alive," Kalana insisted, memories stinging him. "And the rain... it would fall from the sky for days. The Kelani River would overflow. We complained about the mud. Can you imagine? We complained that there was too much water."
        They reached the base of the rock fortress by noon. The famous Lion Paws were gone, eroded by fifty years of relentless sandstorms. The rock itself was bleached white by the sun.
        "Why are we here?" Chimmi asked, collapsing into the sliver of shade offered by a fallen boulder.
        "Because the Old Kings knew," Kalana said. He began to dig at the base of the rock with a rusty trowel. "King Kashyapa didn't just build a palace. He built a machine."
        Kalana wasn't looking for gold. He was looking for the ancient hydraulics. The cisterns. The systems that collected rainwater and stored it deep within the cool heart of the granite.
        He dug for an hour. His hands bled. The heat was nearing 45°C.
        Clink.
        Metal on stone.
        Kalana brushed away the sand. It wasn't an ancient stone slab. It was a rusted hatch, stamped with the emblem of the Sri Lankan Army, dated 2035—just before the Collapse.
        "The Retrofit," Kalana breathed. "The rumors were true."
        He pried the wheel. It groaned, the seal cracking. A puff of stale, cool air hissed out.
        "Chimmi, come."
        They slid into the darkness.
        Inside, it wasn't a palace. It was a bunker, retrofitted into the ancient cisterns. It was dark, illuminated only by the dying beam of Kalana’s flashlight.
        And there, in the center of the damp stone room, was a sound.
        Drip. Drip. Drip.
        Chimmi froze. "What is that noise?"
        "That," Kalana said, tears cutting tracks through the dust on his face, "is the sound of the past."
        In the center of the room was a condensation trap—a simple device harvesting the moisture from the deep earth. A slow, steady drop of water fell into a stone basin.
        It wasn't a river. It wasn't a lake. It was maybe three liters of water.
        But next to the basin, under a dusty UV light that had long since burned out, was a glass box. Inside the box, preserved in nutrient gel, was a single, green sprout.
        A Bo sapling.
        Chimmi walked up to it. She reached out and touched the glass. Her eyes went wide.
        "It's... it's the color of your stories," she whispered.
        "It's Green," Kalana choked out.
        He scooped a cup of water from the basin and handed it to her. She drank, her eyes closing in ecstasy as the cool liquid hit her parched throat.
        "We stay here," Kalana said, sliding to the floor, his journey done. "We guard the drop. And we guard the Green."
        Outside, the wind howled across the barren, scorched plains of the dry zone, burying the history of the island under another layer of sand. But inside the rock, deep in the dark, the heart of Sri Lanka was still beating. Faintly.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="title">Part II: The Seed Keeper</h1>
    <p class="note">
        Three weeks had passed in the belly of the rock.
        Time was measured only by the rhythm of the drops falling into the basin. Drip. Wait. Drip. It was the heartbeat of their new world.
        Chimmi spent her days sitting cross-legged in front of the glass box. The Bo sapling had grown two millimeters. To Chimmi, this was a miracle greater than the sun rising. She spoke to it. She named it Kiri (Milk), because it was the most precious thing she knew.
        Kalana, however, watched the hatch.
        The bunker was safe, but the condensation trap was old. It produced just enough water for two people to survive if they sat perfectly still. But Kalana knew the rule of the desert: resources attract predators.
        The banging started at midnight.
        It was a dull, rhythmic thudding against the metal hatch above.
        Chimmi scrambled back into the corner, clutching her knees. "Baba? Is it the wind?"
        Kalana picked up his heavy iron crowbar. "The wind doesn't knock, Chimmi."
        He climbed the rusted ladder, his heart hammering against his ribs. If it was raiders, he would have to fight. He was old, but he had the high ground. He pressed his ear to the cold steel.
        "Open..." a voice rasped from the other side. Weak. Parched. "Please."
        It wasn't a shout. It was a whimper.
        Kalana hesitated. The logic of the wasteland was simple: Compassion kills. If he opened the door, he let in the heat, and he let in a mouth that would drink their water.
        "Go away," Kalana shouted. "There is nothing here."
        "I... smell... the damp," the voice cracked. "Just... a sip."
        Then, silence. A heavy thud, like a body collapsing against the metal.
        Kalana looked down at Chimmi. She was looking at the sapling. What would the tree do? The Bo tree was sacred because it gave shade to anyone who sat under it, even demons.
        Kalana swore under his breath. He spun the wheel.
        The hatch hissed open. searing heat poured in, followed by a body tumbling down the ladder shaft.
        The stranger hit the floor with a groan. It was a young man, wrapped in layers of tattered rags that had once been a saffron robe. His lips were cracked and bleeding. He was delirious.
        Kalana was on him in a second, crowbar raised. "Who are you?"
        The young man didn't answer. He just pointed a trembling finger at the stone basin.
        Chimmi ran forward, dipping a metal cup into the water.
        "Chimmi, no!" Kalana barked. "That's two hours of water!"
        She ignored him. She held the cup to the stranger's lips. He drank frantically, coughing, spilling precious drops onto his dusty chest.
        When he finished, he slumped back, his eyes clearing. He looked at Kalana, then at the crowbar, and finally, his gaze landed on the glass box.
        He froze. He scrambled to his knees, crawling toward the sapling.
        "Don't touch it," Kalana warned, stepping between the man and the tree.
        The stranger began to weep. Not out of sadness, but out of awe. He reached into the folds of his dirty robes and pulled out a heavy, sealed pouch made of thick leather.
        "I thought I was the last," the stranger whispered. "I thought I was carrying the dead."
        He untied the pouch. Inside, nestled in dry cotton, were seeds. Hundreds of them. Rice. Chili. Pumpkin. Winged Bean.
        "I am Suren," the stranger said, looking up at Kalana. "I came from the seed bank in Gannoruwa. I have carried these for three years. I have the children, but I have no mother to feed them."
        He looked at the condensation trap. "You have the water."
        Kalana lowered the crowbar. He looked at the seeds—tiny, dormant promises of a future that had been stolen. He looked at the water dripping slowly into the basin. And he looked at the Bo sapling, Kiri, stretching its pale green leaves toward the artificial light.
        They had the water. Suren had the seeds. Sigiriya had the walls.
        "It will take time," Kalana said, his voice gruff, hiding the sudden surge of hope in his chest. "The soil outside is dead. We will have to make new earth. We will have to compost."
        Suren smiled, his cracked lips stretching painfully. "I have nowhere else to go, Uncle."
        Chimmi walked over and sat between the two men. She looked at the seeds, then at the water, and finally at the sapling.
        "We are going to need a bigger garden," she said.
        And for the first time in fifty years, inside the dark heart of the rock fortress, Kalana didn't feel like the last survivor of a dead world. He felt like the first gardener of a new one.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="title">Part III: Roots in the Rust</h1>
    <p class="note">
        It had been sixty days since Suren fell down the shaft.
        The smell in the bunker had changed. It no longer smelled of just stale dust and old metal. It smelled faint, sharp, and earthy. It smelled of life decomposing to create life.
        They had turned the far corner of the cistern into a garden bed. They used everything. Bat guano scraped from the high ceilings of the cave, their own waste, and the few dried leaves blown in from the vents. Suren worked the mixture with his bare hands, treating the foul compost like gold dust.
        "The soil is hungry," Suren would say, mixing in a cup of water. "We have to feed it before it feeds us."
        Chimmi was the guardian of the Dambala (Winged Bean). Suren had chosen it for its resilience. They had planted three seeds in a hollowed-out ammunition crate.
        Every morning, Chimmi would shine the dying UV lamp on the dirt for four hours—all the battery power they dared to spare.
        "Baba! Look!"
        Kalana looked up from sharpening his crowbar. Chimmi was pointing at the dirt. A pale, hooked neck of green had broken the surface.
        "It’s waking up," Chimmi whispered.
        Kalana felt a lump in his throat. It was the first new life he had seen born in twenty years. But he didn't smile. He couldn't afford to.
        "Good," Kalana grunted. "But plants need light. And the battery is dying."
        That was the new enemy. The ancient military battery powering their ventilation and the UV lamp was blinking red. Without it, the plants would wither in the dark, and the air in the bunker would turn to poison.
        "I have to go up," Kalana said, standing. "There are solar panels on the western face. The Old Kings didn't put them there, but the Army did. If I can wire them down..."
        "It's high noon, Uncle," Suren warned, looking up from the soil. "The heat will cook you."
        "Better me than the plants," Kalana said.
        He wrapped his head in thick cloth, soaked in water. He climbed the ladder.
        The hatch hissed open, and the sun hit him like a physical blow. The light was blinding. The heat was a solid wall, pressing against his skin.
        Kalana scrambled out onto the bleached white rock of Sigiriya. The wind whipped at his robes. He crawled on his belly, moving toward the rusted array of solar panels bolted to the rock face near the edge of the drop.
        He reached them. They were covered in inches of red dust.
        He began to wipe them clean with his rag. As the dust cleared, the black glass gleamed.
        Then, he saw it.
        Movement.
        Not the wind. Not a shifting dune. But an unnatural, straight line of dust rising from the horizon to the North.
        Kalana pulled out his binoculars. His hands shook.
        Vehicles. Three of them. Heavily modified, covered in jagged scrap metal and spikes. They were tearing across the dried lake bed, heading straight for the rock.
        Iron Eaters. Scavengers who stripped ruins for metal and flesh.
        They weren't here for the water. They didn't know about it. They were here for the steel of the solar panels Kalana was currently cleaning.
        Kalana froze. If he ran back to the hatch now, they might see the movement. If he stayed, he would be seen.
        He looked down at the wires in his hand. If he didn't connect them, the Dambala would die. Chimmi’s hope would die.
        The lead vehicle roared, its engine sound carrying over the wind.
        Kalana made a choice. He ripped the wire from the panel, shoved it into his pocket, and rolled backward over the edge of the drop, landing on a narrow ledge two meters down.
        He pressed himself against the burning rock, hidden from the plateau above but trapped.
        Above him, he heard the screech of brakes. Voices. Heavy boots on the stone.
        "Check the panels!" a voice shouted. "Grab the copper!"
        Kalana closed his eyes. He was trapped outside. Chimmi and Suren were trapped inside. And between them were men who would burn the world for a rusted bolt.
        The seed had sprouted, but the desert had come to claim its tithe.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="title">Part IV: The Titan's Blood</h1>
    <p class="note">
        The metal groaned above him. Kalana pressed his cheek against the searing granite, listening to the sounds of dismantle.
        Rrrrip.
        There went the inverter.
        Clang.
        There went the frame.
        Every sound was a blow to the future. Those panels were the only reason the air in the bunker was breathable. They were the sun for the Dambala plant. Without them, the bunker would become a tomb within days.
        "Boss! This copper is cooked," a voice shouted from the plateau. "Brittle."
        "Take it anyway," the leader snarled. "The tech-boys in Anuradhapura will pay for scrap."
        Kalana closed his eyes. They weren't even going to use them. They were going to melt them down for scrap metal. The injustice of it burned hotter than the rock against his skin.
        He checked his pocket. He still had the wire. Useless now.
        He looked down. Two hundred feet below, on the dusty terrace where the Water Gardens used to be, the three scavenger vehicles were idling. They were monsters of welded iron and stolen parts.
        But monsters need hearts.
        Kalana saw the thick black cables running from the lead truck's engine block to a massive, jury-rigged battery bank strapped to the side. It was a military-grade power cell, likely stolen from a tank wreck. It was ugly, leaking, and heavy.
        But it held enough charge to run the UV lamp for a year.
        Kalana looked at his hands. They were blistered and shaking. He was sixty years old. He was dehydrated.
        For Kiri, he thought. For the Green.
        He didn't climb back up. He climbed down.
        He moved like a gecko, finding fingerholds in the ancient brickwork that tourists used to photograph. The wind buffeted him, trying to peel him off the face of the rock. His muscles screamed.
        By the time he reached the terrace, his vision was swimming. He hid behind the ruins of a brick wall.
        There was one guard. A boy, barely eighteen, holding a rusted speargun, leaning against the lead truck. He was distracted, trying to shake a scorpion out of his boot.
        Kalana picked up a stone. He wasn't a soldier. He was a grandfather. But desperation had carved him into something sharper.
        He threw the stone hard to the left, clattering it against the remains of a fountain.
        The boy jumped, leveling the speargun. "Who's there?"
        The boy moved toward the noise.
        Kalana moved toward the truck.
        He reached the battery bank. It was held on by frayed cargo straps. Kalana pulled his knife—a sharpened piece of car suspension—and sawed at the webbing.
        Snap.
        The battery, the size of a cinder block, shifted. It was incredibly heavy. Kalana braced himself and slid it into his arms. The weight nearly buckled his knees. Acid residue burned his chest through his tunic.
        He turned to run.
        "Hey!"
        The boy had turned back. He saw the old man clutching the power cell.
        The boy raised the speargun.
        Kalana didn't run. He couldn't outrun a spear. He looked the boy in the eye. "It's for a tree," he croaked, the words making no sense to a child of the wasteland.
        The boy hesitated. Maybe it was the madness in Kalana's eyes. Maybe it was the sheer absurdity of a thief stealing a battery instead of water.
        Honk! Honk!
        The horn from the plateau blared. The scavengers were coming down.
        The boy flinched, looking up at the rock. In that split second of distraction, Kalana vanished into the maze of the Water Garden ruins, clutching the heavy lead block like a newborn child.
        He didn't go back to the main hatch. He knew the ancient drainage tunnels. He squeezed into a dry culvert, dragging the battery behind him, deeper into the dark earth.
        Hours later, the hatch in the bunker floor opened.
        Suren and Chimmi leaped up, weapons ready.
        Kalana crawled out, covered in red dust and grease, his chest burnt, his hands bleeding. He kicked the heavy battery onto the floor.
        "Baba!" Chimmi cried, rushing to him.
        Kalana coughed, spitting out red grit. He pointed to the dying UV lamp, which was now flickering like a failing heartbeat.
        "Plug it in," Kalana wheezed. "Feed... the light."
        Suren scrambled to wire the stolen battery to their system. Sparks flew. The connection bit.
        Hummmmm.
        The UV lamp surged to life, brighter than before. A steady, purple-white glow bathed the corner of the room.
        Under the light, the Dambala plant seemed to stretch, its leaves turning a vibrant, deep green.
        Kalana lay back on the cold stone floor, listening to the hum of the light and the distant roar of the Iron Eaters driving away. He closed his eyes. He had traded his body for a battery. It was a fair price.
        "Is it safe?" Chimmi asked, holding his hand.
        "Yes," Kalana whispered, feeling the cool vibration of the rock. "The sun is ours now."
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="title">Part V: The Boy Who Remembered</h1>
    <p class="note">
        Two years later.
        The air inside the bunker was no longer dry. It was thick, humid, and sweet. The single room had become a jungle.
        The Bo sapling, Kiri, was now four feet tall, its heart-shaped leaves brushing the top of the glass case they had been forced to remove. Vines of Dambala snaked up the rusted ladders, and pumpkin vines crawled along the floor like green pythons.
        Chimmi, now ten, moved through the foliage with the grace of a forest creature. She was harvesting chillies—bright red sparks in the green gloom.
        "Careful with the roots," Suren murmured. He was hunched over the battery bank. The Titan's Blood, as they called the stolen battery, was finally showing signs of fatigue. Suren had daisy-chained it to a series of smaller cells scavenged from the old army equipment, creating a fragile heart that kept their artificial sun beating.
        Kalana sat in his chair by the basin. He moved less these days. The acid burns on his chest had healed into tight, shiny scars that constricted his breathing. The dust of the outside world had settled deep in his lungs. He was dying, slowly, like a clock winding down.
        But he was happy. He was breathing oxygen that hadn't existed two years ago.
        Thump.
        The sound came from the ventilation shaft—the one leading to the Lion's Paws.
        Suren froze. He killed the lights instantly.
        In the sudden darkness, the three of them held their breath. They knew the drill. Silence was survival.
        "Is it them?" Chimmi whispered, clutching her basket of chilies.
        "Maybe," Kalana wheezed. "Or maybe a rockfall."
        Thump. Thump.
        It was rhythmic. Intentional. Someone was dropping stones down the shaft. It was a signal.
        Kalana struggled to his feet. "Turn on the perimeter monitor, Suren. Low power mode."
        Suren flipped a switch. A grainy, black-and-green image flickered onto a small screen. It showed the base of the rock fortress, captured by a hidden camera Kalana had rigged months ago.
        There was a vehicle. Not a war-truck. A small, battered rover, steaming in the heat.
        And a figure.
        He was standing right in front of the camera, looking up at the rock. He was holding his hands up, palms open. He wasn't holding a weapon. He was holding a jagged piece of white cloth—a surrender flag.
        Kalana squinted at the screen. The figure looked familiar. Taller, leaner, scarred... but the eyes. He knew those eyes.
        "It's the boy," Kalana whispered.
        "The guard?" Suren asked, tense. "The one who let you go?"
        "Yes."
        "He could be a scout," Suren warned. "He could be leading the whole pack."
        "He's alone," Kalana said. "Look at him. He's leaning against the rock. He's hurt."
        Kalana grabbed his walking stick. "I'm opening the hatch."
        "Baba, no!" Chimmi cried.
        "He saved us once, Chimmi. He gave us the battery. If he wanted us dead, we would have died two years ago."
        Kalana climbed the ladder, slower this time. He spun the wheel. The heat of the day punched him in the face, a reminder of the hell that still burned outside.
        He looked over the edge.
        The boy—now a young man of twenty—looked up. His skin was blistered. His lips were cracked. He looked like he had walked through fire.
        "You're real," the boy rasped, his voice sounding like grinding stones. "I thought... I hallucinated you."
        "I am real," Kalana said. "Why are you here?"
        The boy collapsed to his knees. "They are coming. The Iron Eaters. They found the energy signature of the battery. They know it's here."
        Kalana felt a chill that had nothing to do with the desert night.
        "When?"
        "Two days. Maybe three. They are bringing the Drill."
        The boy reached into his tunic and pulled out a small, wrapped bundle. He held it up.
        "I stole the regulator," he choked out. "For the drill. They can't run it without this. It will slow them down."
        He swayed, his eyes rolling back. "I just... I wanted to see the tree. Before I die. You said... it was for a tree."
        Kalana didn't hesitate. "Suren! Get the rope!"
        They hauled the boy up. He was heavy with exhaustion. They dragged him down into the cool, humid sanctuary of the bunker.
        When the hatch sealed shut, Suren turned on the lights.
        The boy gasped.
        He lay on the floor, staring up. He didn't see the rusty ceiling. He saw the canopy of the Bo tree. He saw the hanging beans. He smelled the damp earth and the sharp scent of crushed chili leaves.
        He started to cry. Great, heaving sobs that shook his dusty frame.
        "It's green," he wept. "It's actually green."
        Chimmi walked forward. She took a cup of water—water that had cycled through the leaves of the tree—and held it to his lips.
        "I am Chimmi," she said softly. "This is Kiri." She pointed to the tree. "And you are safe here."
        The boy drank, then looked at Kalana. "My name is Jith. And you are not safe. Not anymore."
        "We have the regulator," Suren said, holding up the stolen part. "We have time."
        "Time to run?" Jith asked.
        Kalana looked at the garden. He looked at the roots that had broken through the concrete floor, searching for the ancient water table. He looked at the history they had grown in the dark.
        "No," Kalana said, his voice finding a strength it hadn't had in years. "We don't run. We are roots now. And roots hold the earth."
        He looked at Suren, then at Jith.
        "We have three days to turn this rock into a fortress again. King Kashyapa held off an army from this summit. We will do the same."
        Kalana touched the trunk of the Bo tree.
        "The desert wants to eat us," Kalana said. "Let it break its teeth on the Green."

    <h1 class="title">Part VI: The Lion's Breath</h1>
    <p class="note">
        The preparations began at dawn, though there was no sun in the bunker—only the eternal, humming purple light of the garden.
        Jith was weak, but his knowledge of the Iron Eaters was a weapon sharper than any spear. He drew maps in the condensation on the cool stone floor.
        "They travel heavy," Jith explained, coughing as Suren applied a poultice of crushed medicinal leaves to his burns. "Three 'War-Rigs'. Armored. Spiked. They don't use the stairs; they use the Ramp. They’ll try to drive the Drill straight up to the Lion's Paws."
        "The Ramp is crumbled," Kalana noted.
        "They have bridge-layers. They are engineers of destruction." Jith looked up, his eyes hard. "Their leader is called Rust. He doesn't want the battery anymore. He wants the 'Ghost Signal'. He thinks you are hiding pre-collapse tech. If he finds this garden... he will burn it. He hates anything he can't weld."
        Suren looked at his hands, stained with soil. "We are gardeners, not soldiers."
        "Then we fight like gardeners," Kalana said, standing up. "We use the landscape."
        For two days, they worked. They didn't build walls; they built traps. Suren took the precious supply of chili powder—the harvest of two years—and mixed it with fine, dried bat guano and ash. He packed the mixture into clay pots Kalana had fired in a makeshift kiln.
        "The Lion's Breath," Kalana named them. "If we can't shoot them, we will blind them."
        On the third day, the horizon turned brown.
        A dust cloud, miles wide, swept toward Sigiriya. The roar of engines vibrated through the granite, shaking the leaves of the Bo tree. Kiri seemed to shiver, sensing the vibration of violence.
        "Chimmi," Kalana said, kneeling before her. "You stay with the tree. If they breach the hatch... you know what to do."
        Chimmi nodded, tears in her eyes. She held a small, sharp trowel. "I cut the taproot. I bury the seed pod deep. I hide."
        "Good girl."
        Kalana, Suren, and Jith climbed the ladder. They emerged onto the blinding white plateau of the Lion's Paws. The heat was already rising, 40°C and climbing.
        Below them, the Iron Eaters arrived.
        They were terrifying. Three massive trucks, clad in rusted armor plates, roaring like beasts. The middle one carried the Drill—a massive, spinning conical bit designed to bore through bank vaults.
        They didn't stop to negotiate.
        A harpoon fired from the lead truck, embedding itself into the rock face fifty feet below the plateau. A cable pulled taut.
        "They're climbing!" Jith shouted.
        "Let them come," Kalana said. He stood near the edge, his robes whipping in the hot wind. He looked like an ancient spirit of the rock.
        The first wave of scavengers began to scale the cable. They were gaunt, desperate men, their faces covered in leather masks.
        "Now!" Kalana signaled.
        Suren and Jith stepped forward. They didn't fire guns. They hurled the clay pots.
        The pots smashed against the rock face, right above the climbers. The wind, channeled by the unique geometry of the Lion Rock, caught the powder.
        A cloud of red chili dust and blinding ash exploded outward, engulfed the climbers.
        Screams echoed off the canyon walls. It was a primal agony. The scavengers clawed at their eyes, their throats closing up. They lost their grip, sliding down the cables or falling onto the trucks below.
        "Pepper!" a voice roared from the ground. "They're throwing spice! Burn them out!"
        The lead truck angled a flamethrower upward. A stream of liquid fire arched toward the plateau.
        "Back!" Jith tackled Kalana, rolling him away from the edge just as the fire licked the stone.
        The heat was intense. The air smelled of gasoline and burning rock.
        "They're bringing the Drill up the causeway!" Suren shouted, pointing to the west.
        The massive machine was grinding up the debris slope, crushing boulders under its tracks. It was aiming for the sealed ventilation shaft—the weak point.
        "We can't stop that thing with chili powder," Jith yelled.
        Kalana looked at the Drill. Then he looked at the massive, precariously balanced boulder perched above the western approach—one of the ancient "defensive rocks" the kings had set up but never used. It had waited 1,500 years for this moment.
        "The lever!" Kalana pointed to the rusted ironwood beams wedged under the boulder.
        They ran. The flamethrower roared again, singing Kalana’s robes. They reached the boulder.
        "Push!"
        Kalana, Suren, and Jith threw their weight against the ancient timber. It groaned. It didn't move.
        The Drill was fifty meters away. Its bit began to spin, a high-pitched scream of metal.
        "It’s too heavy!" Suren cried.
        Kalana looked at his family. He looked at the rock that protected the green heart of the world. He closed his eyes and summoned the strength of every rice farmer, every stone mason, every ancestor who had toiled on this island.
        "PUSH!"
        With a crack like a gunshot, the timber snapped.
        Gravity took over.
        The boulder, the size of a house, tipped. It rolled. It bounced once, shattering a ledge, and then fell through the air with terrifying grace.
        It struck the Drill dead center.
        There was no explosion. Just the sickening sound of metal being flattened. The Drill crumpled like a tin can. The impact shook the entire mountain.
        Silence followed.
        The dust slowly settled. The Drill was destroyed. The climbers were broken.
        But the leader, Rust, was not done.
        From the wreckage of the third truck, a lone figure emerged. He was huge, clad in a suit of hydraulic power-armor stripped from a forklift. He was holding a thermal lance—a tool that could cut through the hatch in minutes.
        He began to climb the stairs, step by heavy step. The chili powder didn't affect his sealed helmet. The rocks bounced off his armor.
        He reached the plateau.
        Jith charged him with a spear. Rust backhanded him, sending Jith flying into the wall. Suren tried to tackle him; Rust threw him aside like a ragdoll.
        Kalana stood before the hatch. He had no weapons left. Just his walking stick.
        Rust stopped. His helmet hissed.
        "You have ten seconds, old man," Rust’s voice boomed from a speaker. "Move, or I melt you."
        "There is no gold down there," Kalana said, standing his ground.
        "I don't care. I want to see what you're dying for."
        Rust stepped forward, raising the lance. The tip glowed white-hot.
        Kalana raised his stick to strike, a futile gesture against the iron giant.
        Creak.
        The hatch behind Kalana opened.
        "Wait!" A small voice rang out.
        Chimmi climbed out. She wasn't holding a weapon. She was holding a glass jar.
        Inside the jar, glowing in the sunlight, was a single, perfect, green chili pepper.
        Rust froze. The lance wavered.
        "What is that?" he rasped.
        "Food," Chimmi said, her voice trembling but clear. "Real food. Not paste. Not rat meat. Green food."
        She stepped past Kalana, walking up to the armored giant. She held the jar out.
        "If you burn us," Chimmi said, "you burn the seeds. You burn the future. And you will eat dust forever."
        Rust stared at the jar. He stared at the vibrant green color—a color he hadn't seen in decades. It was a color that triggered a memory deep in his drug-addled, violence-hardened brain. A memory of a grandmother. A memory of a garden.
        The thermal lance lowered.
        Rust reached out with a massive, armored metal hand. He took the jar delicately. He brought it close to his faceplate.
        He looked at the chili. Then he looked at the barren, grey wasteland stretching out behind him. And then he looked at the little girl who didn't smell like fear, but like earth.
        "Is there... more?" Rust asked, his voice losing its mechanical edge.
        "Yes," Kalana said, stepping forward. "But it needs water. And it needs guardians. Not destroyers."
        Rust looked at his broken convoy. He looked at his defeated men. He looked at the bunker entrance.
        Slowly, the hydraulic armor hissed as he disengaged the lance. It clattered to the ground.
        "We have a tanker of water," Rust muttered. "Dirty. But filterable."
        "We have seeds," Suren said, standing up, clutching his bruised ribs. "And we have soil."
        Rust took off his helmet. He was an old man, scarred and tired, his eyes weeping from the sheer brightness of the green in his hand.
        He took a bite of the raw chili. He chewed. The heat hit him—the burn of life. He gasped, tears streaming down his face.
        "It burns," he laughed, a rusty, broken sound. "By the gods, it burns."
        He looked at Kalana.
        "Open the door, Gardener. We are done fighting."

    <h1 class="title">Epilogue: The Emerald Rock</h1>
    <p class="note">
        Sixty Years Later.
        The wind still blew across the dry zone, but it was no longer hot. It carried moisture.
        A drone flew over the landscape, its camera panning across the horizon. It didn't see a desert.
        It saw a forest.
        It started at the base of Sigiriya—a dense, dark ring of ironwood and kumbuk trees. From there, it spread outward like a green shockwave, reclaiming the dried lake beds. Canals, dug by hand and machine, crisscrossed the land, carrying water from the restored cisterns.
        The drone climbed higher, approaching the summit of the rock.
        The Lion Paws were still there, but they were covered in vines. The summit, once a barren white cap, was now a crown of emerald. Gardens terraced down the sides, overflowing with wing beans, pumpkins, and rice.
        In the center of the summit, where the palace once stood, was a massive tree. Its canopy was so wide it shaded the entire peak. A Bo Tree. The Great Kiri.
        Under the shade of the tree sat an old woman. Her skin was the color of teak, and her hair was silver.
        "Tell us again, Grandma Chimmi," a group of children asked, sitting cross-legged on the soft grass.
        Chimmi smiled. She looked at the statue standing near the tree's trunk. It was a statue of two men—one holding a crowbar, the other holding a thermal lance—standing back to back.
        "Long ago," Chimmi began, her voice strong and clear, "the world was dust. And the sun was a hammer."
        "But then," a little boy interrupted, pointing to the fruit hanging from the branches. "The Roots fought back?"
        "No," Chimmi corrected gently. "The Roots didn't fight. They waited. They held on. And when the Iron broke, the Green was still there to catch the pieces."
        She looked out over the horizon, where storm clouds were gathering—thick, heavy, and grey. Real rain was coming.
        "The Pearl was never gone," Chimmi whispered to the wind. "It was just waiting for us to remember how to polish it."
