        The locals called it Dumbara—the Misty Mountains. To Arjun, it was "Sector 4B," a prime location for the proposed eco-luxury glamping project.
        Arjun was a man of measurements. He trusted lidar scans, satellite topography, and the solid blue line of his GPS. He did not trust stories about Yakas (demons) or ancient guardians. He was a surveyor for a Colombo development firm, and he was currently three kilometers off the marked trail, looking for a waterfall that showed up on the satellite map but didn't seem to exist in reality.
        "Sir, we should turn back," his guide, Banda, said. Banda was a local villager who chewed betel nut and looked at the trees as if they were listening. " The sun is going down. This part of the forest... it breathes differently."
        "It’s just trees, Banda," Arjun said, tapping his tablet. "The waterfall is two hundred meters north. I just need one geo-tag, and we’re done."
        Arjun pushed through a thicket of bamboo. When he looked back, Banda was gone.
        There was no sound of footsteps retreating. No snapping twigs. Just sudden, absolute silence.
        "Banda?"
        Arjun turned a full circle. The jungle, which had been loud with crickets and monkeys a moment ago, was now dead quiet. The air grew heavy, smelling not of damp earth, but of something older—like burning camphor and crushed jasmine.
        Arjun looked at his tablet. The screen flickered. The blue dot representing his location began to spin wildly, then vanished.
        No signal.
        "Fine," Arjun muttered, his heart rate spiking. "Old school compass it is."
        He reached for the compass on his belt. The needle wasn't pointing North. It was spinning in lazy, hypnotic circles.
        A thick, white mist began to pour down from the canopy, sliding down the tree trunks like slow-moving water. Within seconds, visibility dropped to zero. Arjun stumbled forward, panic rising. He tripped over a root and fell hard into the leaf litter.
        When he looked up, he wasn't in the jungle anymore.
        He was standing in a clearing. But the trees here were enormous, their roots taller than houses. And in the center of the clearing sat a man.
        The man was ancient. His skin was the texture of bark, and he wore a simple loincloth. He was smoking a clay pipe, the smoke forming shapes of animals that drifted into the air and didn't dissipate.
        "You are loud," the old man said. He didn't speak Sinhala or English, yet Arjun understood him perfectly. It was felt in the chest, not heard in the ears.
        "Who are you?" Arjun scrambled back. "Where is my guide?"
        "The guide knows the boundaries," the old man said, puffing on the pipe. "You do not. You measure the land with your little glowing boxes. You try to cut the mountain into squares."
        "I'm just doing my job," Arjun stammered. "I'm a surveyor."
        "A surveyor," the old man mused. "You draw maps. But you only map what you can see. You miss the heavy things."
        "Heavy things?"
        "The memories," the old man said. He pointed the pipe at Arjun. "This rock you sit on? A king hid here a thousand years ago, bleeding from a brother's betrayal. That stream? A mother cried there for a lost child until the water turned salty. You want to build a swimming pool on top of a sorrow?"
        Arjun blinked. He looked at the tablet in his hand. It felt ridiculous now. A toy.
        "I... I didn't know."
        "Because you do not listen," the old man sighed. He stood up. He was impossibly tall, stretching up until his head seemed to brush the canopy. "The mountain is not real estate, little map-maker. It is a library. And you are walking on the pages with muddy boots."
        The mist swirled violently. The old man began to dissolve into the fog, his form becoming one with the white bark of the trees.
        "Go back," the voice boomed, vibrating in Arjun’s teeth. "Leave this place blank on your map. Some places are meant to be lost."
        "Wait!" Arjun screamed. "Which way is out?"
        "Follow the silence."
        Arjun squeezed his eyes shut as the wind roared around him. He felt a hand on his shoulder and screamed.
        "Sir? Sir!"
        Arjun gasped, snapping his eyes open.
        He was back in the bamboo thicket. Banda was shaking him. The sun was exactly where it had been before.
        "Sir, you froze," Banda said, looking concerned. "You were staring at that tree for five minutes. Are you okay? Leech bite?"
        Arjun looked around. The jungle was loud again. His tablet was humming with a full signal. The GPS showed the waterfall was just fifty meters ahead. A perfect spot for the luxury deck. Millions of rupees in revenue.
        Arjun looked at the massive tree in front of him. Its bark looked strangely like the skin of an old man. He could smell a faint trace of camphor and jasmine.
        He looked at the map on his screen—the grid of "Sector 4B."
        "Banda," Arjun said, his voice trembling.
        "Yes, Sir?"
        "There's nothing here."
        "Sir? The waterfall is right there."
        Arjun tapped the screen. Delete Waypoint. Delete Project File.
        "It's unstable," Arjun lied, shoving the tablet into his bag. "Soil erosion. Too dangerous for construction. The whole ridge is bad. We can't build here."
        Banda looked at Arjun. A slow, knowing smile spread across the guide’s face. He nodded respectfully.
        "If you say so, Sir. The mountain is tricky like that."
        "Let's go," Arjun said, turning his back on the perfect location. "Let's go home."
        As they walked away, Arjun didn't check his compass. He didn't need to. He simply walked quietly, careful not to step too heavily on the memories beneath his feet.
