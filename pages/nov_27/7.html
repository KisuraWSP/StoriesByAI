        In Ratnapura, the earth bleeds luck. It is a city built on the gamble that beneath the rice paddies and the rubber plantations, the soil holds pieces of petrified light.
        Nimal was a "mud-man." He was the lowest rung of the gem mining ladder. He didn't own the land, he didn't own the pump, and he certainly didn't own the license. He was just a body paid a daily wage to climb down the slippery bamboo scaffolding into the pit, shovel the heavy, wet gravel (the illama) into wicker baskets, and haul it up to be washed.
        It was monsoon season. The pit was unstable, the walls weeping brown water.
        "One more basket, Nimal!" the mine owner, Mr. Dias, shouted from under his umbrella. "Then we wash."
        Nimal dug. His shovel hit something that didn't feel like rock. It felt dense. He scooped the mud into the basket and began the climb.
        At the surface, they stood in the river, swirling the baskets. This was the moment of truth. The mud washed away, leaving the heavy pebbles at the center.
        Nimal swirled. The brown water cleared.
        And there it was.
        It sat in the center of the frantic pile of quartz and tourmaline—a lump the size of a chicken egg. Even covered in grime, it glowed with a deep, terrifying electric blue. It was a Cornflower Blue Sapphire. A king stone. A retirement plan. A new life.
        Mr. Dias had turned away to light a cigarette. The other miners were busy with their own baskets.
        The demon of Greed does not knock; it simply walks in.
        In a motion practiced a thousand times in his head but never performed, Nimal’s hand slipped from the basket to his mouth. He popped the stone in. It tasted of ancient dirt and iron. He gagged, forced it past his tongue, and tucked it into his cheek like a massive wad of betel nut.
        "Nothing here, Boss!" Nimal shouted, spitting out a stream of saliva to mask the bulge in his cheek. He dumped the rest of the gravel back into the river.
        That night, Nimal didn't go to the teashop with the other miners. He walked home in the rain, his jaw aching, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird.
        He lived in a small breezeblock house with a tin roof. His wife, Lakshmi, was cooking dhal.
        "You're early," she said.
        Nimal didn't answer. He went into the bedroom, locked the door, and spat the stone into his hand. Under the dim bulb, it was blinding. It was worth more than the entire village.
        If I sell it, he thought, Dias will know. He knows the yield. He will send thugs.
        If I cut it, he thought, the lapidary will steal it.
        If I tell Lakshmi, he thought, she might tell her mother. And her mother talks.
        The suspicion was immediate and total. The stone, cold and blue, seemed to whisper to him: Trust no one.
        Days turned into weeks. Nimal stopped going to the mine. He told Lakshmi he was sick. He spent his days sitting in the dark bedroom, clutching the stone.
        "Nimal, we need money for rice," Lakshmi said one evening, knocking on the door. "Go to work."
        "I have work here!" Nimal shouted. "I am thinking!"
        He wasn't thinking. He was guarding.
        The paranoia began to rot him. He heard footsteps outside the window at night. He imagined the shopkeeper looked at him suspiciously. He was convinced Mr. Dias knew.
        One night, a stray dog knocked over a dustbin outside. Nimal leaped out of bed, grabbing a kitchen knife.
        "They are coming!" he screamed.
        "Who?" Lakshmi cried, terrified. "Nimal, you are going mad! What are you hiding?"
        She reached for his clenched fist.
        "Don't touch it!" Nimal roared, shoving her away. She fell, hitting her head against the wall.
        Silence filled the room. Lakshmi looked at him, blood trickling from her forehead, her eyes filled with fear and betrayal. She didn't see a rich man. She saw a monster.
        She packed her bag that night. "Keep your secret, Nimal," she wept. "I cannot live with a ghost."
        She left.
        Nimal was finally alone. Just him and the stone.
        He was hungry. The electricity was cut off because he hadn't paid the bill. The roof was leaking.
        He sat on the floor, holding the sapphire. It was flawless. It was perfect. It was everything he had ever wanted.
        He tried to imagine the mansion he would build. But he couldn't leave the house to sell the stone. If he stepped out, they would get him. If he slept, they would take it.
        He realized then the cruel geometry of his greed. The value of the stone was imaginary until it was sold. But to sell it, he had to trust someone. And greed had taken his ability to trust.
        Nimal sat in the dark, shivering in the damp air. He was the richest man in Ratnapura. He held a fortune in his palm.
        He brought the stone to his lips. He was starving.
        "Can I eat you?" he whispered to the blue rock.
        The stone did not answer. It just shone, beautiful and useless, illuminating the ruin of a man who had traded his life for a rock he could never let go of.
