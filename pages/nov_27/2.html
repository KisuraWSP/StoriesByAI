        Kandy doesn't have evenings; it has a slow, grey suffocation. The mist rolls down from the Hanthana mountain range, choking the lake, blurring the line between the water and the sky until the whole city feels like it is underwater.
        Jaliya sat on a concrete bench near the Walakulu Bemma—the Cloud Wall bordering the lake. He was wearing a jacket that was too warm for Colombo but barely enough for the damp chill of the hill capital.
        In his pocket, wrapped in a dirty handkerchief and stuffed inside a matchbox, was a twenty-two-carat Blue Sapphire. The "Cornflower Blue." It was worth more than the lives of the three men who had died mining it in an illegal pit near Ratnapura.
        Jaliya was just the courier. The mule.
        He checked his watch. 6:05 PM. The Thevava drums from the Temple of the Tooth began to thunder across the water—a deep, resonant booming that vibrated in Jaliya's chest. To the pilgrims in white carrying lotus flowers, the sound was a blessing. To Jaliya, it sounded like a gavel banging on a judge's desk.
        Boom. Boom. Boom.
        "You look like a man waiting for a ghost," a voice said.
        Jaliya didn't jump. In this line of work, jumping got you killed. He turned slowly.
        Standing there was Perera, a man who looked like a retired geography teacher but was actually the most ruthless fence in the Central Province. He was eating roasted peanuts from a paper cone.
        "The mist is heavy tonight," Perera said, sitting down next to him, leaving a respectful foot of distance. "Good for business. Bad for the joints."
        "Do you have the money?" Jaliya asked. He didn't look at Perera. He looked at the Queens Hotel across the street, its colonial white facade glowing yellow in the streetlights.
        "Impatient," Perera tutted. "You young ones. You steal a stone from the earth and think you own the timeline." He tossed a peanut shell into the darkness of the lake. "Did you were followed?"
        "No. I took the train. Second class. Got off at Peradeniya and took a bus."
        "Smart. The train station is watched." Perera finished his peanuts and dusted his hands. "Let me see it."
        Jaliya hesitated. The walkway was crowded. couples huddled under umbrellas, tourists snapping photos of the Temple, sellers hawking glowing toys.
        "Here? It's too open."
        "Hide in plain sight, Jaliya. If we go into a dark alley, we look like criminals. Here, we are just two uncles discussing cricket."
        Jaliya reached into his pocket. His hand was sweating. He slid the matchbox along the rough concrete of the bench.
        Perera covered it with his palm instantly. The move was a magic trick; the box vanished into his sleeve. He brought a jeweler's loupe to his eye, shielding it with his cupped hand, and took a quick, three-second peek inside the sleeve.
        He grunted. "The cut is rough. But the color... the color is deep."
        "It's pure," Jaliya whispered. "Now pay me. I want to catch the night mail back."
        "Back to where? The south?" Perera laughed softly. "You think you can leave Kandy with that money? This valley is a bowl, son. It catches everything that falls."
        "What are you talking about?"
        "The police aren't looking for the stone, Jaliya. They are looking for you."
        The air in Jaliya’s lungs turned to ice. "You set me up."
        "No. I’m saving you. Look."
        Perera nodded toward the Queen's Hotel. Under the awning, two men in plain clothes were scanning the crowd. They weren't tourists. They had the posture of hunting dogs.
        "CID," Perera whispered. "They found the body of the mine foreman this morning. You left a boot print."
        Jaliya stood up, panic seizing his legs. "I didn't kill him. It was a collapse!"
        "Does it matter?" Perera sighed. He placed a heavy hand on Jaliya's wrist. "Sit down. If you run, they see you. If you run, you die."
        "So what do I do?" Jaliya hissed, tears of frustration stinging his eyes. The drums from the temple grew louder, a relentless, holy rhythm mocking his sins.
        "You have two choices," Perera said, his voice calm, like a grandfather telling a bedtime story. "Choice A: You walk over to them and surrender. You get twenty years. You lose the money."
        "And Choice B?"
        Perera smiled, a sad, jagged expression. He slid the matchbox back to Jaliya.
        "Choice B: You give the stone to the Temple."
        Jaliya stared at him. "What?"
        "Drop it in the donation box. The big one by the entrance. Anonymous offering. Then you walk out, empty-handed. The police are looking for a man with a sapphire. If you have no sapphire, you are just a tourist."
        "You're crazy," Jaliya said, clutching the matchbox. "This is five million rupees."
        "It's evidence," Perera corrected. "And it's cursed. I won't touch it with the CID watching. No one will buy it now. It’s dead weight, Jaliya. It will drag you to the bottom of this lake."
        Perera stood up and buttoned his cardigan. "I'm going home to have dinner. You have five minutes before those men cross the street. Decide, Jaliya. Money or freedom? You can't have both."
        Perera walked away, disappearing into the mist like he had never existed.
        Jaliya sat alone. The matchbox felt heavy, like it weighed a thousand kilos. He looked at the dark water of the lake, then at the bright lights of the Temple across the road.
        The detectives stepped off the curb, moving toward the lake.
        Jaliya stood up. He felt the cold rain on his face. He didn't run. He turned toward the Temple entrance, where the white-clad pilgrims were walking barefoot on the moonstones.
        He joined the queue, a sinner hiding among the saints, clutching a fortune he could never spend, walking toward the sound of the drums.
