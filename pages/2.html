    <p class="note">
    The video was forty-two seconds long. That was all it took to dismantle forty-five years of quiet, invisible existence.
    Sugath was a man of beige. He wore beige trousers, drove a beige sedan, and lived a life of beige neutrality. He was an accountant who double-checked his receipts and never parked in the "No Parking" zone. He was not a villain. He was just tired.
    But the internet does not care about fatigue. It does not care about the heatstroke inducing humidity of a Tuesday afternoon, or the fact that Sugath’s diabetic mother had just been rushed to the ICU, or that the delivery rider had cut across three lanes of traffic and smashed the side mirror off Sugath’s car.
    The video, shot on a high-definition smartphone from a passing trishaw, only showed the reaction.
    It showed Sugath, red-faced and sweating, screaming at a young boy in a helmet. It captured the ugliest three words Sugath had ever spoken in a moment of blind adrenaline. It didn't capture the apology he offered two minutes later. It didn't capture him handing the boy a thousand rupees for the trouble.
    It only captured the rage.
    By Wednesday morning, Sugath was trending.
    He boarded the train to Fort as he did every day, but the air felt different. Usually, the morning commute was a collective misery of bodies pressed against bodies, a shared struggle for oxygen. Today, there was a bubble around him. A vacuum.
    A university student in the corner whispered to his friend, tilting his screen. They looked up, eyes darting to Sugath’s face, then back to the glowing blue light. They snickered. It wasn't a loud laugh; it was a sharp, jagged sound that cut through the clatter of the train tracks.
    He is the Uncle from the video.
    The angry one.
    The monster.
    Sugath stared at his shoes. He could feel the judgment radiating from the crowd like heat off tarmac. This was Society. It wasn't a law, or a judge, or a police officer. It was a thousand eyes. It was the collective decision to unmake a person.
    At the office, the security guard—who usually greeted him with a salute and a joke about cricket—looked away, suddenly fascinated by a stain on the floor.
    The walk to his cubicle felt like walking the plank. Conversations died as he passed. Heads lowered. Typing became furiously loud. They had all seen it. The Group Chat, that invisible nervous system of the office, would have been buzzing since dawn.
    "Mr. Sugath," the HR manager said later, not asking him to sit. "We have to think about the company's image. We have values."
    "It was a misunderstanding," Sugath pleaded, his voice small, sounding guilty even to his own ears. "I was stressed. My mother..."
    "We understand," the manager said, his voice smooth and empty. "But the optics, Sugath. The optics are terrible. Clients are asking questions. We think it’s best you take some time. Indefinitely."
    The walk home was the hardest.
    Society is not just strangers on a train. Society is the neighborhood. It is the auntie two houses down who sweeps her garden at 5 PM. It is the shopkeeper who sells you bread.
    As Sugath walked down his lane, the gate of the Perera house clicked shut. Mrs. Perera, who had known him since he was a boy, who had attended his wedding, turned her back and went inside. The rejection was absolute. It was a physical blow.
    He reached his own gate. His wife was inside, the curtains drawn, the lights off. She hadn't answered his calls. She was afraid to go to the market. She was afraid to open WhatsApp. He had infected her with his shame.
    Sugath stood in his garden, the noise of the city humming around him. He realized then that he was no longer a person. He was a meme. He was a cautionary tale. He was a vessel into which Society poured its self-righteousness so they could feel better about their own hidden sins.
    He looked at his phone. A new notification. Someone had found his address.
    Found him, the comment read. Let’s go teach him a lesson.
    Sugath looked up at the darkening sky. There were no bars on his windows, no chains on his door. But as he looked at the closed shutters of his neighbors and the turning backs of his friends, he realized he was in a prison far more secure than any jail cell.
    He was trapped in the glass wall of public perception. Everyone could see him, but no one could hear him screaming.
