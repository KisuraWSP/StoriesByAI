    The ceiling fan was the only thing moving in Elias’s world, and even that was struggling. It clicked rhythmically—click, whir, click, whir—a metronome counting down the seconds of a life that felt like it had already ended.
    Elias lay on a mattress that smelled of stale sweat and old sickness. His body was a map of failures. The chemotherapy had hollowed him out, leaving his skin translucent and his bones sharp enough to cut. But the cancer was just the physical tenant; the landlord was the darkness in his head.
    The anxiety was a constant hum, a swarm of bees behind his eyes. You are a burden. You are expiring. There is no point. The depression was the gravity that pinned him to the sheets, making the act of reaching for a glass of water feel like climbing Everest.
    He looked at the nightstand. Three orange pill bottles. A glass of water. And a letter from the bank about foreclosure he hadn't opened in weeks.
    "Today," Elias whispered to the cracking plaster of the ceiling. "I think today is the day I stop."
    It wasn't a dramatic declaration. It was just a surrender. He closed his eyes, welcoming the void. He let the panic rise, let the grief of his wasted years wash over him, preparing to let go of the tether.
    Then, the world went black.
    A power cut. The fan died. The streetlights outside blinked out. The sudden silence was deafening.
    In the absolute darkness, Elias’s anxiety spiked. The bees swarmed louder. He couldn't see his hands. He felt like he was already in the grave. His breath came in short, ragged gasps. This is it, he thought. The end is just darkness.
    Knock. Knock. Knock.
    The sound was small, hesitant. Elias froze. He wanted to ignore it. He wanted to die in peace.
    Knock. Knock. "Mr. Elias?"
    A child’s voice. Tiny. Trembling.
    Elias groaned, the sound scraping his throat. He swung his legs off the bed, his joints popping, pain shooting through his spine. He used the wall to navigate, his fingers tracing the peeling paint until he found the door handle.
    He opened it.
    Standing in the hallway was Maya, the seven-year-old girl from the apartment across the hall. Her mother worked double shifts; Maya was often alone in the evenings.
    She was holding a single, sputtering candle in a jar. Her eyes were wide, filled with a terror that Elias recognized. It was the same terror he lived with every day. The fear of the dark. The fear of being alone.
    "The lights went out," Maya whispered, clutching the jar. "And... and I can't find my mom's flashlight. And the shadows are moving."
    Elias looked at her. He saw his own fear reflected in her face. But in that mirror, he saw something else. He saw a child who needed him.
    For the first time in months, the bees in his head went silent. The pain in his bones receded, pushed back by an ancient, instinctual need to protect.
    "It's okay," Elias croaked. He cleared his throat, forcing his voice to be steady. "It's just the grid, Maya. It happens."
    "Can I... can I sit here? Just until the lights come back?"
    Elias looked back at his dark, suffocating room. The pill bottles were invisible now.
    "Yeah," Elias said. "Yeah, you can come in."
    He shuffled back, allowing the small circle of warm, orange light to enter his tomb. They sat on the floor of his living room. The candle flickered, casting long, dancing shadows against the wall.
    "I'm scared," Maya admitted, hugging her knees.
    "Me too," Elias said. It was the most honest thing he had said in years.
    Maya looked at him, surprised. "You? But you're a grown-up."
    "Grown-ups get scared too, Maya. Sometimes the dark feels very big."
    Maya reached into her pocket and pulled out a crinkled piece of paper. "I was drawing a sun when the lights went out. Do you want to see?"
    She held it near the candle. It was a crude, crayon drawing of a yellow sun with a smiley face, wearing sunglasses. It was ridiculous. It was beautiful.
    "It's a good sun," Elias said.
    "You look sick, Mr. Elias," she said innocently. "You look like a ghost."
    "I am sick, Maya. Very sick."
    "Will you get better?"
    Elias looked at the candle. He looked at the girl huddling in its glow, trusting him to keep the monsters away. He realized then that he couldn't leave yet. He couldn't leave her in the dark.
    "I don't know," Elias said, and a tear tracked through the dust on his cheek. "But I'm here right now. I'm right here."
    The candle burned steadily between them, a tiny, defiant star in a universe of black. It wasn't a cure. It wasn't a miracle. But as Elias watched the flame dance in the little girl's eyes, he realized the darkness wasn't absolute.
    As long as there was one person to guard the light for another, the darkness did not win.
    Elias took a deep breath. It hurt, but the air felt different. It felt like oxygen.
    "Tell me about the sun," Elias said softly. "Tell me why it's wearing sunglasses."
    And as Maya began to explain, Elias decided to wait. He would wait for the lights to come back on. He would wait for tomorrow.
